# Usage

`./run.sh copy "folder/with/files/tabDnsRouters" "dnsRouter -> healthCollector"`

This will change all the files, folders and content with the word "dnsRouter" to "healthCollector".

`./run.sh rename "folder/with/files/tabDnsRouters" "dnsRouter -> healthCollector"`

This will do the same, but to a new folder that will be copied from the source.
